Hello and Welcome!
My name is Abhishek.
This project is created following the neog.camp-lesson-four session.
I learned a lot new things creating this project for example :
1.document.queryselector()
2.fetch() API
3.addEventListener()

This project takes the input from the user and using the fetch API process converts the user input into the desired result.
This project is Pig Latin Translator.
Userinput can be anything the user intends to write.
The generated output is the translation of the userinput into that language.
